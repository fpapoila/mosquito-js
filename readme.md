## Mosquito JS

A JavaScript Mosquito.

Some cool ideas:
- Noise through web audio api
- Option for multiple mosquitos
- Noise based on scroll (deeper in the page, or faster you scroll)
- Amount of mosquitos based on scroll, multiplying the noise
- Breeds?
- That annoying noise they make when they stop?
