## Mosquito JS

A JavaScript Mosquito.

Some cool ideas:
- Noise through web audio api
- ~~Option for multiple mosquitos~~
- ~~Noise based on scroll (deeper in the page, or faster you scroll)~~
- ~~Amount of mosquitos based on scroll, multiplying the noise~~
- ~~Breeds?~~
- ~~That annoying noise they make when they stop?~~
